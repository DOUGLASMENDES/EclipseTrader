Command objects: all possible request types originate here.

<p/>
Contains command objects, describing the request 
to the OpenTick server. Every command object is a simple POJO
object, that allows configuration via property injection
(instantiation using default constructor, then setting 
all the properties), and via non-default constructor.
<p/>
Some properties of a command object may be optional, bearing
a sensible default. This provides some level of convenience
when creating command objects.
