Classes to output JDOM documents to various destinations.  The most common
outputter class is XMLOutputter which outputs a document (or part of a
document) as a stream of bytes.  Format and EscapeStrategy support the
XMLOutputter in letting you choose how the output should be formatted and how
special characters should be escaped.

SAXOutputter lets you output as a stream of SAX events (handy especially in
transformations).  JDOMLocator supports SAXOutputter and helps you observe the
SAX output process.

DOMOutputter lets you output a JDOM document as a DOM tree.
