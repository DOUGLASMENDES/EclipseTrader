<H1>Moving Average Channels - MACH</H1>
<p>

<p>
Upper and lower moving average channels (also called straight envelopes) are drawn at a certain percentage above and below the moving average. The channels are drawn according to the formula:
<li>Upper channel line = MA + MA * Channel coefficient</li>
<li>Lower channel line = MA - MA * Channel coefficient</li>
</p>
<p>
  A well-drawn channel contains the bulk of prices, with only a few extremes poking out. Adjust the coefficient until the channel contains
approximately 95 percent of all prices for the past several months.
</p>
<p>
  Different trading vehicles and timeframes require different channel
widths. Volatile markets require wider channels and higher coefficients.
The longer the timeframe, the wider the channel; weekly channels tend to
be twice as wide as dailies.
