<H1>Installing new features with the update manager</H1>

<p>To locate and install a new feature into a product (ordinarily requires web 
  access):
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open the Install Wizard by clicking <b>Help &gt; Software Updates &gt;
    Find and Install</b>. This opens the wizard. </li>
  <li>Select the second button, &quot;<b>Search for new features to install</b>&quot; and 
  click <b>Next</b>.</li>
  <li>Create a bookmark for an update site where Eclipse features and plug-ins 
  are published. In the sites to search list, select <b>Add&nbsp; Update Site</b> to 
  add a remote site, or <b>Add Local Site</b> if the site is available on a local drive 
  (including a CD), or <b>Add Archived Site</b>, when the site is available locally 
  but is packaged as a jar or zip file.</li>
  <li>In the add site dialog, give the site a name such as 
    &quot;CompanyA&quot; and enter the URL such as
	&quot;http://companyA.example.com/eclipseupdates&quot;.</li>
  <li>After adding the site, expand it to the
    categories of feature versions available at that update site. This will
    contact the web site to discover what features are available.</li>
  <li>Select the categories you want to search and click <b>Next</b>.</li>
  <li>Wait for the search to finish and selecting the features to be added. You 
  can view the description or more detailed properties for any feature by 
  selecting the feature and pressing the &quot;Properties&quot; button.</li>
  <li>Once you're decided which features to install, click <b>Next</b>.</li>
  <li>Carefully review the license agreements for the  features. If the
    terms of all these licenses are acceptable, check &quot;I accept the terms
    in the license agreements&quot;. Do not proceed to download the features if
    the license terms are not acceptable.</li>
  <li>If a feature selected for install include optional features, a page will
    show up allowing you to select whether you want them installed or not.
    Optional features typically carry functionality that is not essential for
    proper functioning of the main feature.</li>
  <li>The Install Location page controls where the new feature's files are to be
    installed on the local computer. Select the directory into which the product
    is installed and hit <b>Next</b>. (If the product is installed in a
    directory to which you do not have write access, you should contact your
    system administrator and get them to install this feature so that it will be
    generally available. The other option is to click <b>Add</b> and point to a 
  directory to which you do have write access.</li>
  <li>Feature versions can be digitally signed by the company that provides
    them. This allows you to verify more easily that the features and
    plug-ins that are about to be downloaded and installed are coming from a
    trusted supplier.</p><br> <b>Warning:</b> Because of the possibility of harmful or even
    malicious plug-ins, you should only download features from parties that
    you trust.</p><br> <p>Click <b>Install</b> to allow the downloading and installing
    to proceed.</p></li>
  <li>Once the new feature and plug-ins have been downloaded successfully and
    their files installed into the product on the local computer, a new
    configuration that incorporates these features and plug-ins will be
    formulated. Click <b>Yes</b> when asked to exit and restart the workbench for the
    changes to take effect. To add other new features at the same time before
    restarting, click <b>No</b> and repeat. If this was a new feature and can be 
  dynamically installed into the current configuration, you will also be 
  presented with a <b>&quot;Apply Now&quot;</b> button. This will not restart the 
  platform, but configures the feature and the plug-ins into the current 
  configuration.</li>
</ol>
