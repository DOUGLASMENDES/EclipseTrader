<H1>Inspecting the current configuration</H1>

<p>The About Eclipse Platform dialog (<b>Help &gt; About Eclipse Platform</b>) 
  shows most of the important information about the features and plug-in configured in 
  the product. To find out further detailed information about the current configuration:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open the update configuration manager by clicking <b>Help &gt; Software Updates &gt; 
  Manage Configuration</b>. This opens the Product Configuration dialog.</li>
  <li>In the Product Configuration dialog expand the root node (current&nbsp; 
  configuration).
    The first tier of items are locations on the local computer where the files
    for features and plug-ins are stored. For a typical product, all features
    are installed in a single directory sub-tree. However, a feature that is
    installed as an extension of another product are usually located in a
    separate directory sub-tree.</li>
  <li>Expand the location to see the feature versions installed there.</li>
  <li>The nesting of the features indicates which child features are included in
    a given parent feature. Nested features act as a unit.</li>
  <li>Select a feature version and click <b>Show Properties</b> to open the 
  Properties dialog which presents more detailed information about the selected feature.</li>
  <li>Click <b>Show Disabled Features</b> filter on the toolbar of the Product
    Configuration dialog. Any feature versions that are disabled are now
    shown (you might not have any). Disabled feature versions are ones that are
    installed on the local computer but excluded from the current configuration.
    At most one version of any given feature can be present in a given
    configuration; usually the ones with the lower version numbers will be in a
    disabled state.</li>
  <li>In the Properties dialog of a feature, click <b>Status</b> to find out whether
    the selected feature is configured exactly as packaged. The status will show
    when a feature's plug-ins are present at different versions, or disabled due
    to missing prerequisite plug-ins that are expected to be supplied by some
    other feature.</li>
</ol>

<p>
In this dialog you can revert to a previous install configuration, view the installation history, or
even add another eclipse product extension. A product extension is a local folder that has a similar
file layout as the eclipse installation, but with a .eclipseextension marker (instead of .eclipseproduct). 
If you add a product extension, make sure there are no duplicate features in the extension
you add.
</p>
<p>
When the install wizard is used to install features in a user selected location, that location
automatically becomes an eclipse product extension.
