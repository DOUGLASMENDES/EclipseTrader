maximum and minimum registered prices. The color strip just below represents the
buying and selling pressure. Each bar is proportional to the shares quantity for

window and drop on the book window.</p>

<b>Group Prices</b><br>

a price and the quantity columns are representing the sum of all available
proposals. <b>Note:</b> this option works only if the complete book is made available
by the selected data source. For the Italian market this option has no effect.</p>

<p>

last reading. The increases are hilighted with the <b>Positive Value Color</b>
