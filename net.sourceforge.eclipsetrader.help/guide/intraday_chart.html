<p>
The window is split in zones each of which is capable of drawing one or more charts
or indicators. The default setting will draw the closing price chart on the upper
zone and the exchange volume on the lower zone.</p>

Eclipse Trader saves the data to build the intraday charts as they are received
from the selected data source and only for the stocks that are listed in the
Stock Watch window. The window's toolbar allows to update the chart by backfilling
the data, if the data sources supports this feature.</p>
