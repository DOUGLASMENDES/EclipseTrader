/**
 * A buffered source of characters.
 * A Source is very similar to a Reader, like:
 * <pre>
 * new InputStreamReader (connection.getInputStream (), charset)
 * </pre>
 * It differs from the above, in three ways:
 * <ul>
 * <li>the fetching of bytes may be asynchronous</li>
 * <li>the character set may be changed, which resets the input stream</li>
 * <li>characters may be requested more than once, so in general they
 * will be buffered</li>
