<TITLE>Thumbelina</TITLE>

<BODY>
Extract the images behind thumbnail images.
This package is a demonstration of filtering the tags that are produced by the
Lexer package.  In this case the idea is to find links to known types of image
file (.gif, .png and .jpg) that have as the link text a reference to a smaller
or lower resolution image, often called a thumbnail image; hence the name.
<p>
Besides a lot of support code to provide a user interface, the heart of the
process is found in <code>Thumbelina.extractImageLinks()</code>, which has a wee
state machine that notes when an &lt;IMG&gt; tag is discovered within the body
of an &lt;A&gt;&lt;/A&gt; tag pair. This triggers a fetch of the
<code>HREF</code> (image file).
<p>
The fetch is performed in the background by the <code>ToolKit</code> image
loading code which runs 4 threads (on my machine). When an image is received it
is added to the list of pending images. This list is drained by the
<code>Sequencer</code> as it presents images at fixed intervals.
<p>
The <code>TileSet</code> and <code>Picture</code> classes provide a framework
for displaying the various sizes of image that arrive in a random way, while
still being able to repaint the panel when required.
<p>
The images are only retained in memory long enough to get covered over by
subsequent images, but in general, the manipulation of images is a memory
intensive task which requires a higher than normal limit on the maximum
heap memory, i.e. use the <code>-Xms256M</code> command line switch to
avoid <code>java.lang.OutOfMemoryError</code> messages.
<p>
The rest is just the UI code, that can be altered by intrepid programmers as
they see fit.
