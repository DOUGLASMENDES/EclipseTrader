    <TITLE>Tabby</TITLE>
  </HEAD>
  <BODY>
The Tabby program is a demonstration of how to use the underlying Lexer
classes to perform file I/O. The results could also be achieved with a normal
Reader object but then there wouldn't be anything interesting about this.
<p>
The task is to replace tabs with spaces and preserve any indentaion that was a
combination of tabs and spaces. This means honouring the 'tab stops' that would
be used by an editor and not just a global search and replace.
<p>
The mechanism used is to keep track of the character offset from the beginning
of a line and when a tab is encountered add spaces till the next tab stop.
<p>
At the same time any "\r\n" combinations that are in the file are converted to
simple "\n" characters as found on Unix/Linux systems, and trailing whitespace
at the ends of lines is removed.
<p>
The trick is to only write the file if something in the file required changes,
so a boolean variable is kept current with a <code>true</code> value indicating
the file needs to be modified.
