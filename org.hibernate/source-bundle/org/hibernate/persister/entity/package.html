	This package abstracts persistence mechanisms for
	entities, and defines the Hibernate runtime
	metamodel.
</p>
<p>
    Strategies for persisting entities implement the
    <tt>EntityPersister</tt> interface. Optionally, 
    they may implement certain additional interfaces
    that define contracts with various loaders.
    Concrete implementations in this package define
    the built-in inheritance mapping strategies.
